The kernel was installed to /bsd.anoubis

To boot the specific kernel wait until the boot prompt appears and
enter:

	boot> bsd.anoubis

or adapt boot.conf in the following way:

	echo 'set image bsd.anoubis' >> /etc/boot.conf

Remove the package by using 'pkg_delete anoubis-kernel-0.4p0'
which takes care of the extinction of /bsd.anoubis from your system.
