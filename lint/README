This file contains some wrappers around the linters used by Anoubis.

flawfinder
==========

Flawfinder gives pretty much output when no hits are found. This is
unnecessary, so we create a file with no content here.


splint
======

splint is exiting with an error code even a single warning is
found. This is not acceptable. We only want to exit with an error if a
real error is found.


lint
====

The lint utility seems to be available on BSD systems only. It seems to
return an error code on any parse error as well on regular warnings.
