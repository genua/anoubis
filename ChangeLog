2011-01-05 - Changes between 0.9.4 and 0.9.5

New features:

o This release includes packages for OpenSuSE 11.3 and Fedora 13.
o X11 applications running in a playground can now be started in a
  nested and isolated X11 session.
o It is now possible to force removal of dead playgrounds even if some files
  are no longer present.

Bugfixes:

o Creating permanent rules from sandbox escalations was broken. This is
  fixed now.

2010-10-21 - Changes between 0.9.3 and 0.9.4

New features:

o The Playground feature, which introduces a copy on write
  filesystem for selected processes that are started in a playground session.
  It also includes graphical and CLI management tools.
  With these tools / features it is possible to selectively discard or commit
  changes to the real filesystem when the a playground is halted.
  To secure the commit operation it is possible to configure optional content
  scanners, i.e. anti virus software, which can determine if the selected
  files pose any risk to the integrity of the system, and if needed alert
  the user or reject the commit entirely in case a virus is detected.
o Implemented a process browser in xanoubis, which greatly simplifies
  the examination of Anoubis rulesets and other details for each process
  on the system. This feature uses the Anoubis daemon's built-in process
  tracking to list all processes and is especially useful for debugging and
  correlating processes to rulesets or playground sessions.
o added support for Ubuntu Lucid and Debian Squeeze
o introduced 'anoubisctl ps' command
o introduced 'anoubisctl stat' command
o added kernel based SFS/Sandbox exceptions
o added some library support for mount points and file names
o added some more tray icons in different sizes (for smoother scaling)
o created userland and kernel source repository on sourceforge.net
o kernel source packages for .deb and .rpm now also available
o copy button in rule editor (for cloning rules)
