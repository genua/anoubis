.Sh NAME
.Nm struct anoubis_auth

.Nm anoubis_auth_destroy
.Nd Protocol level authentication interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In anoubis_msg.h
.In anoubis_auth.h
.Ft struct anoubis_auth *
.Fn anoubis_auth_create "struct achat_channel * chan" "anoubis_auth_callback_t finish" "void * data"
.Ft void
.Fn anoubis_auth_destroy "struct anoubis_auth * auth"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module is used to handle client authentication at the anoubis protocol
level.
Once the client requests authentication with an
.Em ANOUBIS_C_AUTH
message an authentication object is created with
.Nm anoubis_auth_create.
All of the
.Em ANOUBIS_C_AUTHDATA
messages that are exchanged during authentication must be handled by a
custum dispatch function in the caller.
Once authentication is complete that dispatcher must fill in the result of
the authentication into the
.Nm anoubis_auth
structure associated with the server and call the callback function
.Va finish.
Any messages that must be sent during authentication
are sent directly to the channel
.Va chan.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm anoubis_auth_create
returns a pointer to the new authentication structure or
.Em NULL
if no memory was available.
