.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program manages the checksums form the
.Xr anoubisd 8
daemon.
.Pp
Options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
Prints debug information to the console.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Pp
Path specification:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Apply command to all files under each directory, recursively.
.It Fl f Ar listfile
Accept input form file
.Ar listfile .
Use "-" for stdin.
.El
.Pp
Type specification:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u
Apply command for checksums with
.Ar uid .
If argument is
.Ar all ,
all registered uids will be used.
You need root privileges to do this.
.El
.Pp
Key files (needed by some operations):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Load private key from 
.Ar keyfile .
If not specified,
.Pa ~/.xanoubis/private.pem
is used.
.It Fl -cert Ar certfile
Load certificate file from
.Ar certfile .
If not specified,
.Pa ~/.xanoubis/default.crt
is used.
.El
.Pp
Filter specification:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width DST
.It Fl -sum
Apply command for a checksum.
.It Fl -sig
Apply command for a signature.
.El
.Pp
.Ar command
.Pp
add - add checksum to the shadow tree matching the current content of
.Ar file .
.Pp
del - delete checksum of
.Ar file
from the shadow tree.
.Pp
get - returns the checksum of
.Ar file
found in the shadow tree.
.Pp
list - list all entries found in the shadow tree.
.Ar file
given as argument.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
connects via the
.Em libanoubischat
protocol to the
.Xr anoubisd 8
daemon and issues the given

The program binary is
.Ar /sbin/sfssig .
.Pp
.Ar /var/run/anoubisd.sock
is the default value for the
named
.Ar socket
connection from the GUI or clients
connecting over the
.Ar libanoubischat
and
.Ar libanoubisprotocol
libraries.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Add a entry for a file to the shadowtree:
.Pp
.Dl # sfssig add /tmp/test.txt
.Pp
Delete a entry for all files given by stdin from the shadowtree:
.Pp
.Dl # sfssig -f - del
.Pp
Get all checksum entries with signatures of the shadowtree recursively from
directory
.Pa /tmp
of the user with uid 1001
.Pp
.Dl # sfssig -r -u 1001 get /tmp
